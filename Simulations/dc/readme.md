# DC Simulation

This folder contains the DC simulation results of the two-stage Operational Amplifier designed in Cadence Virtuoso (90nm).

## 🔍 Purpose
The DC analysis is used to:
- Determine the bias points of all transistors
- Verify the operating regions (saturation/linear)
- Estimate power consumption
- Extract small-signal parameters (gm, ro, etc.)

## 📁 Contents
- `dc_plot.png` – Plot of DC operating points (upload your image here)
- `dc_report.txt` – Summary of node voltages and bias currents (optional)

## 🛠️ Tool
- Cadence Virtuoso ADE (90nm PDK)

## 📌 Note
Make sure all devices are biased in the correct region for proper amplifier operation.
